Due to the lack of required data, we would like to concentrate on the business 
problem of site selection for the project. As mentioned before, as a builder, the rate 
of property price increase is one of the most important factors for us to consider 
when choosing the location of our projects. Through accurate market trend analysis 
and property price forecasts, we have been able to identify the three suburbs that 
are expected to experience the highest price increases over the next year, and by 
choosing to invest in these areas with high value-added potential, not only will we be 
able to maximise our returns, but we will also be able to enhance the 
competitiveness of our projects in the marketplace.
